title: Record attempts to alter logon and logout events (lastlog)

description: |-
  The audit system already collects login information for all users
  and root. If the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the
  `augenrules` program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
  default), add the following lines to a file with suffix `.rules` in the
  directory `/etc/audit/rules.d` in order to watch for attempted manual
  edits of files involved in storing logon events:
  
  `-F path=/var/log/lastlog -F perm=wa -F key=logins`
  
  If the `auditd` daemon is configured to use the `auditctl`
  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
  `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file in order to watch for unattempted manual
  edits of files involved in storing logon events:
  
  `-F path=/var/log/lastlog -F perm=wa -F key=logins`
