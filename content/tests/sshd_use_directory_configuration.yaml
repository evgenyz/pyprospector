title: Distribute the SSH Server configuration to multiple files in a config directory

description: |-
  Make sure to have the `Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf` line in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.
  Ideally, don't have any active configuration directives in that file, and distribute the service configuration
  to several files in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` directory.
