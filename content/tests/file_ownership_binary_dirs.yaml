title: Verify that system executables have root ownership

description: |-
  System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
  
  ```
  /bin
  /sbin
  /usr/bin
  /usr/sbin
  /usr/libexec
  /usr/local/bin
  /usr/local/sbin
  ```
  All files in these directories should be owned by the root user.
