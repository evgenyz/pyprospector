title: Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership
description: |
  System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
      /bin
      /sbin
      /usr/bin
      /usr/libexec
      /usr/local/bin
      /usr/local/sbin
      /usr/sbin</pre>
  All files in these directories should be owned by the root user.
