title: Service 'telnet' is permanently disabled

description: |-
  The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which means that data from the
  login session, including passwords and all other information transmitted during the session,
  can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network. The telnet protocol is also subject to
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
