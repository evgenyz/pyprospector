title: Ensure system is not acting as a network sniffer (RUNTIME)

description: |-
  The system should not be acting as a network sniffer, which can
  capture all traffic on the network to which it is connected. Run the following
  to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode:
  
  `$ ip link | grep PROMISC`
  
  Promiscuous mode of an interface can be disabled with the following command:
  
  `$ sudo ip link set dev device_name multicast off promisc off`
