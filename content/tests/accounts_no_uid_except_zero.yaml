title: Verify Only Root Has UID 0
description: |-
  An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
  with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
  guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
  sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
  access to root privileges in an accountable manner.
